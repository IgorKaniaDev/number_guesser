# Number Guessing Game (Binary Search)

This is a simple console game where the computer tries to guess the number you're thinking of between 1 and 400.

## How it works

- The program makes a guess.
- You respond with:
  - `higher` – if your number is higher than the guess,
  - `lower` – if your number is lower than the guess,
  - `yes` – if the guess is correct.

It uses a binary search algorithm to minimize the number of guesses.

## How to run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

```bash
python number_guess_game.py
